# Session Code for The Open Online R Stream

### Wolfgang Viechtbauer

This repo contains the code that I am writing during the current session of the [Open Online R Stream](https://www.wvbauer.com/doku.php/live_streams). During a session, this repo is updated every 60 seconds, so this way, you can easily copy-paste code from the script that I am working on and run the code locally.
