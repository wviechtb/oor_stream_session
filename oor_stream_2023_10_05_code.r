### 11.1: Defining statistical models; formulae

# before we continue, let's look at some examples with categorical predictors

# compare the gas mileage of cars with an automatic versus manual transmission
res <- lm(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars)
summary(res)

# we are fitting this model:
#
# mpg = beta0 + beta1 * am + error
#
# where am = 0 for cars with an automatic transmission and am = 1 for cars
# with a manual transmission, so the intercept is the expected mpg for cars
# with an automatic transmission and the slope for am is the mean difference
# in mpg for cars with a manual transmission compared to cars with an
# automatic transmission

# say am was coded not as a dummy variable, but as a string variable
mtcars$transmission <- ifelse(mtcars$am == 1, "manual", "automatic")
mtcars

# use such a string in the model
res <- lm(mpg ~ transmission, data=mtcars)
summary(res)

# the results are identical
